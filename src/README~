Assignment #: 5

Comments:
Instructions:
Type the directories like, "/home/cpsc/JavaStuff/Assignments"
Basically, you need the whole path name for the file directories unless you are searching for the file


// For each directory, start with /home/cpsc/...

// Small Issues:

// 1 - Method 5 puts null at the end of each file
// 2 - You need to type in the full absolute path name of each directory/subdirectory/file you are looking for
// For example, use: /home/cpsc/JavaStuff/Assignments
// 3 - Merged file content isn't logged, but if the method is successfull then a "method success" is written to the file
